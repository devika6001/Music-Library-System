MUSIC LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
In the Music Library System, we will create a portal that will first ask for the sign in of the users for giving them access to the music library. The user will then be free to search up and play the music of his/her choice. 
On entering the portal, the user will be given multiple options for:-
●	View the trending song list of the week.
●	Search a particular song by-
⮚	Name of the song
⮚	Name of the artist
●	View the recently played songs
